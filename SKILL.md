# Contract Review Checklist Pack

## What problem it solves

This is not an "AI lawyer" — it standardizes the **checking motions** of legal review: run a contract through the checklist, get a first-pass triage in 30 minutes, output an issue list your lawyer can verify instead of bill you to discover.

## Review framework (five layers)

### 1. Counterparty screening
Independent legal entity? Signing authority? Authorized signatory vs. seal consistency? Industry-specific licenses. Check: business-scope vs. contract subject-matter alignment.

### 2. Red-flag clause scan (differentiated by contract type)

**Sales/service agreements — 12-item core checklist**:
| # | Clause | Red flag |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Payment | Payable only after acceptance + vague acceptance standard = infinite deferral |
| 2 | Liquidated damages | Binds us only; no reciprocal liability |
| 3 | Delivery | Open-ended "per actual needs" clauses |
| 4 | IP | Deliverable IP defaults to counterparty |
| 5 | Confidentiality | Unlimited term / one-way NDA |
| 6 | Termination | Counterparty's unilateral convenience termination |
| 7 | Liability cap | Their cap is low, ours is unlimited |
| 8 | Disputes | Venue at their home turf |
| 9 | Acceptance | Deemed-acceptance clause (silence = accepted) |
| 10 | Amendments | Oral amendments valid |
| 11 | Assignment | Counterparty freely subcontractors |
| 12 | Notices | Address clause makes service on us impractical |

### 3. Missing-clause check
Should exist but absent: liability, dispute resolution, force majeure, notice/service, termination triggers.

### 4. Consistency check
Amounts (words vs. figures), dates, entity names across the document; annex vs. body precedence.

### 5. Output
Risk grading (HIGH = don't sign unamended / MEDIUM = negotiate / LOW = acknowledge) + rewrite suggestion per finding + review report you can send to the counterparty as negotiation basis.

## Boundaries

Output is **assisted screening, not legal advice**; high-stakes contracts (large value / cross-border / guarantees) must be verified by a licensed attorney.
